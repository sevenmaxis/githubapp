Github has a pretty sweet API. We would like you to build some application that is based on Sinatra and provides one of the following features:
 
1. Take commit statistics for one public organization of your choice (or github.com/rails if you perefer)
2. Continuosly collect all pull requests, pull request reviews, pushes and comments
3. Render most active users within the last hour per organization's project
4. Render most active users withing the last day
 
We like using Git, so we want you to like using Git. Please commit early and often.
We would like to see some tests, you are free to write them with Test: Unit, MiniTest or RSpec, the choice is up to you.
Please deliver a working application that can run locally. We'd prefer delivery via a github repository, this will also let us see your approach to commiting your code.
 
Use some sort of visualization framework if you want to show your frontend skills, like D3.js maybe?
